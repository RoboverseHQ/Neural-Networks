So as map iterates through circle_areas, during the first iteration, the first element of circle_areas, 3.56773 is passed along with the first element of range(1,7), 1 to round, making it effectively become round(3.56773, 1). During the second iteration, the second element of circle_areas, 5.57668 along with the second element of range(1,7), 2 is passed to round making it translate to round(5.57668, 2). This happens until the end of the circle_areas list is reached.\n",

That is, what if I pass range(1, 3) or range(1, 9999) as the second iterable in the above function\". And the answer is simple: nothing! Okay, that's not true. \"Nothing\" happens in the sense that the map() function will not raise any exception, it will simply iterate over the elements until it can't find a second argument to the function, at which point it simply stops and returns the result.\n",

    "So, for example, if you evaluate result = list(map(round, circle_areas, range(1, 3))), you won't get any error even as the length of circle_areas and the length of range(1, 3) differ. Instead, this is what Python does: It takes the first element of circle_areas and the first element of range(1,3) and passes it to round. round evaluates it then saves the result. Then it goes on to the second iteration, second element of circle_areas and second element of range(1,3), round saves it again. Now, in the third iteration (circle_areas has a third element), Python takes the third element of circle_areas and then tries to take the third element of range(1,3) but since range(1,3) does not have a third element, Python simply stops and returns the result, which in this case would simply be [3.6, 5.58].\n",

    "Where func is the function on which each element in the iterable gets cumulatively applied to, and initial is the optional value that gets placed before the elements of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. The following should be noted about reduce(): 1. func requires two arguments, the first of which is the first element in iterable (if initial is not supplied) and the second element in iterable. If initial is supplied, then it becomes the first argument to func and the first element in iterable becomes the second element. 2. reduce \"reduces\" (I know, forgive me) iterable into a single value.\n",
